What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Most things seemed to work pretty well... I am proud of getting the store inventory to work. That took a while. I was stuck so went to two TA hours sessions due to syntax errors. 
Also, some things were finicky like requiring me to save before enabling their functionality, or like I ran into a bit of trouble
dealing with a class vs an object and knowing how/when to pick one. I still think that there are many parts of the code that don't need to be there (I have yet to learn what they are) so I would definitely appreciate more feedback on what is necessary/optional. Advice I would give to someone taking this course : Go to TA hours! Also, keep playing. Sometiomes just closing the program and reopening will fix something... computers are weird.
